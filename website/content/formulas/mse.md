A function that measures how well a predicted value `Ŷ` matches some ground truth value `Y`.

It computes the error by taking the difference between the two values and computing the square. In this way, the error is always positive.

You then take the average of the error from all samples by summing the errors up Σ and dividing by the number of samples n.
