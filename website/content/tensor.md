A multidimensional array similar to `numpy.array`.

Tensor is a term that is used in TensorFlow and PyTorch to indicate a multidimensional array. This may be a bit confusing because the mathematical term tensor has a different meaning. The math tensor is a function, that can be represented as an array.

Tensors are data structures that store data. For example, a 1D tensor could store prices of houses, a 2D tensor could store an image, a 3D tensor could store multiple images, etc.
