Indicates how much the function `f` is changing - is it increasing or decreasing.

The derivative is another function that tells you how much the original function is changing at this particular point.

If the derivative is 0, then `f` is not changing. If it's positive, `f` is increasing. If it's negative, `f` is decreasing.
