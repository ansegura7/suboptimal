Summary: Internal variables of the model that will be updated during the training phase (e.g. weights and biases of a neural network).

The model parameters are the internal variables of the model that will be updated during the training phase, for example, in the case of neural networks, the weights or biases of the network.

In some contexts, it is usual to describe a model by its number of parameters.
