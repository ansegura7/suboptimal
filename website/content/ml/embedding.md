Summary: A representation of an object as a list of numbers.

A representation of an object as a list of numbers.

Embeddings are commonly used to create representations of objects or features that are suitable for particular machine learning algorithms.

One example is working with words in Natural Language Processing. Words are usually transformed to a list of numbers (embedded) before given as input to a neural network. The exact mapping between word and the list of numbers will be automatically learned.
