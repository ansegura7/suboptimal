# Contributing to SUBOPTIMAL

Thank you for taking the time to contribute and make machine learning and maths more accessible to beginners!

Feel free to contribute an explanation to any of the categories by creating a pull request.

## Creating a new explanation

Each explanation is stored in a separate Markdown file. The best way to create a new explanation is by copying the content of one of the existing ones and modifying it. You can find all existing explanations [here](/website/content).

You also need to provide some important metadata (in [Pelican](https://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/content.html#file-metadata) format):

-   Title - the full title of the term/formula
-   TitleShort - a short version to be displayed on the cards
-   Date - the date of the contribution
-   Author - your name or pseudonym that will be displayed on the explanation
-   AuthorLink - a link that you want to be associated with your name: Twitter account, GitHub account, personal website etc.
-   Category - category of the contribution, please use one of: `Math Terms`, `Machine Learning Terms`, `Math Formulas`.
-   Slug - short name for the URL
-   Summary - a very short summary of the term/formula to be displayed on the card

## Explanation Guide

-   Always give a very brief and simple explanation in the summary and repeat it in the first paragraph.
-   After that, you can include more details and examples
-   Feel free to include links containing additional resources
-   Try to include images if possible
-   When explaining formulas, include images that explain the individual parts of the formula
